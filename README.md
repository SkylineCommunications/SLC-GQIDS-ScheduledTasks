# SLC-Get-Scheduled-Tasks

This repo contains two ad hoc data sources that retrieve tasks from the scheduler. The input parameters include a Name filter (a regex pattern), start time (the beginning of the time slot for task search), end time (the end of the time slot for task search), and duration (the task duration in seconds, used for visibility purposes only).
